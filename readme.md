# Larceny

____

Unlike runtime errors, compilation errors prevent successful compilation, which
makes them harder to test, since we can't even compile the units tests we want
to write and run to test them!

_Larceny_ makes it possible to write those tests. Code which would normally
fail compilation, for any reason (provided it parses as well-formed Scala) is
permitted inside certain blocks of code, but instead of being compiled and run,
instead returns a list of compilation errors, as runtime values, which are
perfect for testing.

## Features

- suppresses compilation errors on ordinary code blocks
- code must at least parse, but all errors will be lifted to runtime values
- allows compilation errors to be tested in unit testing frameworks
- unit tests on compilation errors can be written in the most natural way


## Availability

Larceny has not yet been published as a binary. It is currently waiting for the
final release of Scala 3.3.

## Getting Started

Larceny is a compiler plugin, and can be included in a compilation with the
`-Xplugin:larceny.jar` parameter to `scalac`:
```sh
scalac -d bin -Xplugin:larceny.jar -classpath larceny.jar *.scala`
```

The compiler plugin identifies code blocks whose compilation errors should be
suppressed, which are inside a `captureCompileErrors` block (using any
valid Scala block syntax), for example:
```scala
package com.example

import larceny.*

@main def run(): Unit =
  captureCompileErrors("Hello world".substring("5"))

  captureCompileErrors:
    val x = 8
    println(x.missingMethod)
```

Here, the code inside each `captureCompileErrors` block will never compile:
the first, because `substring` takes an `Int` as a parameter, and the second
because `missingMethod` is not a member of `Int`.

But despite this, if the Larceny plugin is enabled, then the code will compile.

And any invalid code that is _not_ within a `captureCompileErrors` block will
still result in the expected compilation errors.

The compilation error from each `captureCompileErrors` block will be
returned (in a `List`) from each block. We could adjust the code to see them,
like so:
```scala
@main def run(): Unit =
  val errors = captureCompileErrors:
    "Hello world".substring("5")

  errors.foreach:
    case CompileError(id, message, code, offset) =>
      println(s"[$id] Found error '$message' in the code '$code' with offset $offset")
```

The four parameters of `CompileError` need some explanation:
- `id` is an integer representing the type of error
- `message` is the human-readable error message text that would be output by
  the compiler
- `code` is the fragment of code which would be marked as problematic (often
  with a wavy red underline)
- `offset` is the number of characters from the start of `code` that is
  indicated as the exact point of the error

Taking the second example above,
```scala
captureCompileErrors:
  val x = 8
  println(x.missingMethod)
```
the `message` would be:
```
value missingMethod is not a member of Int
```
while the `code` value would be `x.missingMethod` (note that the surrounding
`println` is not considered erroneous), and the `offset` would be `2`. The
value `2` is because the erroneous code begins `x.`, but the point of the error
is considered to be the `m` of `missingMethod`, which is character `2`.

The error IDs are defined in the Scala compiler and correspond to an
enumeration of values. For convenience, these values are exported into the
`ErrorId` object, and can be accessed by the `errorId` method of
`CompileError`.

`ErrorId` is also an extractor on `CompileError`, so it's possible to write:
```scala
captureCompileErrors(summon[Ordering[Exception]]) match
  case ErrorId(ErrorId.MissingImplicitArgumentID) => "expected"
  case _                                          => "unexpected"
```

### Implementation

Larceny runs on each source file before typechecking, but after parsing. Any
blocks named `captureCompileErrors` found in the the untyped AST will trigger
a new and independent compilation of the same source file (with the same
classpath, but without the Larceny plugin) from _within_ the main compilation.

Since the `captureCompileErrors` blocks should contain compile errors, this
child compilation is expected to fail, but its compilation errors will be
captured. Each compilation error which is positioned within a
`captureCompileErrors` block will be converted to static code which constructs
a new `CompileError` instance, and inserted into the `captureCompileErrors`
block, in place of entire erroneous contents.

If there are multiple `captureCompileErrors` blocks in the same source file,
some errors which occur in earlier phases of compilation may prevent later
phases from running, and the errors from those later phases will not be
captured during the first compilation. Larceny will rerun the compiler as
many times as necessary to capture errors from later phases, each time
removing more code which would have precluded these later phases.

The main compilation is then allowed to continue to typechecking, which will
only see the `CompileError` constructions, not the original code. As long as
there are no compilation errors _outside_ of a `captureCompileErrors` block,
compilation should succeed. When the code is run, each `captureCompileErrors`
block will simply return a list of `CompileError`s.

### Probably

Larceny works well with [Probably](https://github.com/propensive/probably/).

For example, we could write a compile error test with,
```scala
test(t"cannot sort data without an Ordering"):
  captureCompileErrors(data.sorted).head.message
.assert(_.startsWith("No implicit Ordering"))
```




## Status

Larceny is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Larceny is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 124 lines of code.

## Building

Larceny can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Larceny are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/larceny/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Larceny easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

Larceny is the act of unlawfully taking something from someone. _Larceny_ unlawfully takes errors from compiletime and gives them to runtime.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
